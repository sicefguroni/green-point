### From Heat Maps to Green Maps: A GIS-Based Framework for Greening Interventions in Mandaue City, Cebu  

---

## Project Overview  
**GreenPoint** is a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based framework designed to identify, evaluate, and recommend **urban greening interventions** in Mandaue City, Cebu.  
The system integrates satellite imagery, hazard maps, air quality data, socioeconomic indicators, and community-contributed photos to produce a **data-driven Greenery Index (GI)**.  

This index evaluates the **quantity, equity, resilience, and connectivity** of urban green spaces and powers an **AI-driven Recommendation Engine** that generates **site-specific greening strategies** such as pocket parks, street trees, rooftop gardens, and blue-green corridors — all backed by published studies on climate adaptation and environmental health.

## Executive Summary  
Mandaue City faces mounting environmental challenges due to rapid urbanization — including **rising land surface temperatures**, **air pollution**, and **increasing flood and storm surge risks**. These conditions disproportionately impact vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and low-income households.

While **urban greenery** has proven benefits in cooling, pollution reduction, and flood mitigation, planning tools in the Philippines often remain fragmented. They typically visualize environmental data without producing actionable recommendations.

**GreenPoint** bridges this gap through a unified, evidence-based platform that:
- Integrates **multi-source geospatial and environmental data**  
- Computes a comprehensive **Greenery Index (GI)**  
- Generates **AI-based, location-specific greening interventions**  
- Provides **interactive visualizations** to guide decision-making by local governments and communities
